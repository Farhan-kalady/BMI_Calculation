The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator is a simple web-based application developed using the Flask framework in Python. The purpose of this project is to allow users to calculate their BMI by entering their height and weight. The application processes the input on the server and returns the calculated BMI along with a health interpretation such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. A user-friendly interface with basic styling is provided for easy interaction. This project demonstrates key Flask concepts including routing, form handling, and dynamic result rendering, making it an ideal beginner-level project for learning web development using Python and Flask.
